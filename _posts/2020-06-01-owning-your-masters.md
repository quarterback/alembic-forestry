**I first started blogging in early 2000.** I've been writing online off and on since then. There are remnants of archives floating around the web, but I've largely jettisoned old content as I grow in my professional practice. The most memorable things I've hung onto, but otherwise, it's not worth revisiting the roughest of drafts.

As I think about how much content I've poured into Twitter over the years (and Facebook, too.) it's been less about entertaining people -- and rather, about connections. In that purpose, it's mostly been a boon. I would simply not be where I am without the timing of a platform that enabled me to connect with broad swaths of folks I might not otherwise have been able to reach on my own.

This probably came at a cost. The net benefit though registers as a positive in my mind.

As I've cleaned up on my online presence over the past few months, I decided I wanted to start writing regularly again. Much like I did in the old days, there's zero expectation that anyone besides me will read this stuff. In fact, I don't intend to cross-post content or solicit interest. 

These days, I'm not as interested in reaching out to strangers. I'm far more interested in mining my own ideas, developing my own practice, and taking the apply my skills in far more useful ways. Being online is great, but it's often meant eschewing real world opportunities to be useful. I've served on boards, participate in a variety of local non-profit activities, and if you know me IRL at all -- you've heard about the random leagues I've started up around skeeball and other such things. 

Still, I've long sought to apply the tenets of everyday service delivery to regular people in ways that are relevant and impactful. I think the only way to do that is to figure out where to get involved, document the process, and keep iterating. 

In addition to this fledging personal site, I've setup a [Pixelfed instance](https://pics.ronbronson.com/ron), started using Mastodon again & this site is using Forestry CMS, but is a simple Jekyll site served via Github and deployed through Netlify.
