During times of conflict, folks often want to fill in the gaps of their knowledge. [I started this booklist](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/998865?shelf=america-explained) back in 2015 and have added to it periodically. It's relatively broad scope but largely focused on the intersection of race, politics, and policy that have provided both the foundation and the tinder for the current state of America.

I'm listing it here so I have a direct link to share with folks.
